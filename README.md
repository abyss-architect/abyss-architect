# About Me (Abyss Architect)

I push the boundaries of my knowledge and skills through research and practice in aims to reach my main goal - **to create everything I can imagine from scratch**.

## Main Quests

My main quest at the moment is my pursuit of a **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering at Drexel University**.

### Game Developer Progress

I spend a large portion of my time learning how to program so that I can become an **all-round programmer with a main focus in game development**. I currently am aiming to make games with a group of friends under a team name of [TeamVertices](teamvertices.org/?theme=dark). Under this team, I will primarily be programming but I also aim to handle other parts of the game development process such as creating assets, voice acting, etc.

On the other hand, when I am not working under TeamVertices, I aim to make games under my own name of **AbyssArchitect**.

## Side Quests

When I am not completing main quests, I like to do the following in my free time:

+ Program various projects such as websites and small applications
+ Balisong flip
+ Hang out with the boys and game (here is my [Grouvee library](https://www.grouvee.com/user/153920-AbyssArchitect/shelves/942766-playing-with-the-boys/) for the games I am currently playing with the boys)
+ Watch anime (here is my [AniList profile](https://anilist.co/user/AbyssArchitect/))
